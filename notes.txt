Changes:

CakeEntity (amended)
  - rename as simply Cake
  - remove references to Employee
  - add JsonProperty annotation for description field deserialization

CakeFactory (added)
  - class added for use when creating cakes

CakeServlet (amended)
  - fix servlet mappings so servlet runs on "/" and "/cakes" and set so it is initialised on startup
  - replace System out with Logger (using Logback)
  - add package private constructor which accepts class dependencies, and no-arg constructor creating class with default version of dependencies
  - refactor init method so initial cakes are deserialized using jackson, and stored in database using CakeStore class (new)
  - amend doGet method to check accept header and return JSON / HTML depending on presence of "application/json" value
  - add doPost method, which uses the CakeFactory to make a cake and the CakeStore to persist it, then simply runs the doGet method to render suitable output to the user
  - add destroy method to close the Hibernate session on closure

CakeStore (added)
  - added method for retrieving all cakes from the database
  - added method for storing individual cakes to the database
  - rather than living with lots of exceptions when duplicate titles are inserted, check for these in advance and if they are found then update the cake

HibernateUtil
  - make class final
  - add private constructor

src/main/resources/initial-cakes.json (added)
  - copy of the json file previously pulled from github.  Held locally to speed up testing, and allow webapp to function without web connection

src/main/resources/logback.xml (added)
  - added to provide some basic configuration of the log output

src/main/webapp/css/narrow-jumbortron.css (added)
  - copied from bootstrap.com, used for presentation

src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml (amended)
  - fixed web-app tag

src/main/webapp/index.jsp (amended)
  - changed to present the output in a user friendly manner.  Not entirely happy with the look/responsiveness of this but couldnt afford to spend more time on it

CakeFactoryTest (added)
  - junit tests for the CakeFactory

CakeServletTest (added)
  - junit tests for the CakeServlet

CakeStoreTest (new)
  - junit tests for the CakeStore

pom.xml (amended)
  - changed jackson-core to jackson-databind, and updated version
  - add slf4j-api and logback-classic
  - change junit version to 4.12
  - add mockito and hamcrest

Areas where further work might be done if time allowed
  - add cucumber acceptance test / some kind of UI test
  - use some means of object creation / dependency injection such as spring
  - use a NoSQL DB such as MongoDB rather than HSQL
    - personal dislike for the HibernateUtil singleton as it makes junit testing difficult
    - allow json to be written / retrieved direct from database
  - more work on presentation
  - potentially rewrite using Node / Mongoose / React / Mongodb
