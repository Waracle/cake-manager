# This GitHub workflow will build application with Maven,java 17 and cache/restore any dependencies to improve the workflow execution time
# For more information see: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/automating-builds-and-tests/building-and-testing-java-with-maven

# This workflow uses GitHub actions to perform checkout,build and push docker image to docker hub
# We need a Docker ID in Docker Hub and use that as USERNAME and generate one personal access token and use it as password here
# Use GitHub to set the Secret DOCKER_USERNAME and DOCKER_TOKEN which got generated as access token in Docker Hub
